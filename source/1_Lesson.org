- In this project you're going to build a desktop-fan, whose speed can be controlled using a component called a potentiometer.
- The circuit uses a 555 timer chip to control the fan.
- You've had plenty of experience of soldering PCBs by now, so minimal guidance has been provided. However, putting together the actual fan takes time, so you are better off starting early.
** Build It

- Here is the board you will be soldering together.

- Please note, there is one component that needs to be replaced from the original board. The BC639 transistor has been replaced with a TIP122 transistor.

- Solder in your components as shown below.

- Next you'll need to attach your finished PCB to the mounting plate. 
- This is done by screwing the nut onto the potentiometer and the switch.

** Badge It
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Take photos of the solder and component side of your board, and the leads to your switch. Your badge will be awarded according to the quality of your work.
- Now it is time to test your board.
